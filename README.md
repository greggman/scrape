# scrape

A node script to scrape media off a webpage

## Usage

    git clone https://github.com/greggman/scrape.git
    cd scrape
    npm install
    node index.js --dest-dir=path/to/save https://someurl.com/somepath/somepath.html

## Why?

Because everyone needs their own scraper. Every scraper has issues. I'm sure
this one sucks for you but you can look inside to modify to your needs.
